## 🔦 The Problem

In dynamic educational environments like research conferences, blind and visually impaired users are often burdened with pre-navigating digital content instead of exploring freely. This denies them the experience of browsing posters and engaging with interesting work—a core benefit available to their sighted peers.

## 💡 Our Solution

**Telly** is an assistive technology system that transforms physical academic spaces into seamlessly accessible digital environments. Using camera detection and voice interaction, Telly empowers visually impaired researchers and students to navigate information-rich spaces with autonomy, curiosity, and ease.

## 🎙️ How It Works

### For Presenters:
1. **Upload Research Poster** → Upload PDF/image files of research posters
2. **AI Processing** → Content is automatically structured for WCAG 2.2 accessibility compliance
3. **Generate Access Code** → Receive a printable accessibility code (codicon) to place next to your poster
4. **Print & Display** → Place the generated code next to your physical poster

### For Users:
1. **Camera Scanning** → Walk through the venue with the Telly app camera active
2. **Automatic Detection** → App continuously scans for accessibility codes (codicons)
3. **Audio Announcements** → Receive immediate audio cues with poster title and authors
4. **Voice Interaction** → Ask questions naturally: "Tell me more", "Who are the authors?", "What are the main findings?"
5. **Hands-free Exploration** → Navigate and explore content entirely through voice commands
